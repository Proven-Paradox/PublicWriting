# Those Forgotten

This is an inscription at the entrance to  the Forgotten Foundations. Basically a part of the afterlife made for dead (forgotten and ruined) places. I describe it as appearing on a stone obelisk set beneath running water, indicating a place in real life that had the inscription carved on it, then tossed it into a river so it would erode away more quickly to be added to that realm.

Here lies the Forgotten Foundations
The final fate of all homes, cities, and nations.
As all people are cremated, eaten, or entombed
So too will all towers fall that once loomed.
This stone, wrought by mortals and set 'neath the water
Like leading a newborn lamb to slaughter.
Shed no tears, have no fears, be not riven
Those forgotten are also forgiven.
