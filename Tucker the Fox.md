# Tucker the Piper Fox
Created in collaboration with Fenix. 

One day in Hollarville, a new channel appeared on TV. They called themselves a news station, and they said that they were fair and balanced. There was one show on this channel, run by Tucker the Fox, and it called itself a "current affairs program." Tucker would talk and talk, leading his viewers on wild and frantic chases that looped around and over and under all sorts of strange subjects, to the sound of a piper's tune.

There were many who saw the truth of this "news." Propaganda handed down from the old masters of capitol, dogma, and patriarchy. Old Tucker would spout hatred and bigotry in the guise of an opinion show, all while those discordant and petulant pipe played on.

But then something strange happened. Some people started to like those pipes. They'd listen to those lies and believe every one of them. He would lead them through the woods crafted by his words, around trees, over boundaries, under and away from understanding and empathy. It wasn't only the old, and it wasn't all of them either, but the people of Hollarville soon could see that the Piper Fox was stealing their elders away.
