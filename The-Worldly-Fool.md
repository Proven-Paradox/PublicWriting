# The Worldly Fool

On January 7th, 2021, it was being reported that Kevin Greeson had died after tasing himself in the crotch. Later fact checkers would report that this was false, that he had died of a heart attack that was not related to the unsecured taser in his pocket. This clarification came too late for the Worldly Fool, who read this information on his phone and promptly laughed to death.

Now, the fact that he took so much mirth from the death of someone else is reason enough on its own that he would not be stepping beyond the Pearly Gates. (For what it's worth, most self identifying Christians won't be either. If you do not understand why, I suggest you read the Bible.) He was understandably nervous as he  watched the scenery from Charon's boat. The cruise ship had entire shelves full of Dante's Inferno to read through, advertised as tour guides. They also had cliff notes versions on hand, which the Fool was using for a quick self evaluation.

Any strikes for Lust? Not really, unless Hell was ultra conservative about its definitions. Sex out of wedlock, yeah, but that was about it. He shrugged and decided to place his bets on Hell actually not giving a damn about that. Literally. Yeah, the sign said abandon all hope and all that, but the Fool could see no downside to trying.

Next level. Gluttony? A little bit, yeah. But mostly when he was younger and too busy in college to give a damn. He'd lost a lot of weight in the last few years of his life. Maybe they'd let him off with a warning.

Greed? Not really.

Anger? Strike one.

Sullenness? Strike two.

Heresy? Now that he thought about it, wouldn't Hell *like* heretics? Those are the guys spreading your good word. Damned either way, might as well hope Dante got that one wrong.

Murder? Only virtually. Surely that wouldn't count.

Suicide? No.

Blasphemers and--oh, an explicit note that Hell doesn't actually punish gay dudes in the brochure, that was reassuring. 

Panderers, seducers? No. Flatterers? Fucking no. Simony? The fuck did that even mean? Shit. Sorcerers and false prophets, no. Corrupt politician, no. Hypocrite, hopefully not. Thieves, evil counselors, evil advisors, no, no, no. Divisive; same thing with Heresy. Falsifies, alchemists, perjurers, counterfeiters, no, no, no, no.

Treachery? No.

So... two strikes. Two and a half? The relative lack of screaming and crying from the outside was reassuring. (The rather serious surplus of it on the inside was not.)

The ship pulled up to a dock, and a voice over the loudspeaker said, "Thank you for traveling Charon Cruises. We will begin disembarking with group A. Please stand and calmly walk to the exits. Procrastinators will be prodded. Trust us, you do not want to get prodded twice. Don't like it? Tough shit, welcome to Hell."

He looked to his ticket. Group G. Probably had a long time to wait. Maybe being off later was a good sign? The Fool took a look over the folks in Group A who were getting ready to walk out. Most of them looked scared as hell. The Fool decided to take that as a good sign.
