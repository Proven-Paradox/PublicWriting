# Brother Backwoods and Brother Bayou

Mother Mountain and Father Time wanted a big family back before things broke down between the two of them, and the triplet Sisters were just the start of things. The second time Mother Mountain gave birth, it was to a pair of brothers: Brother Backwoods and Brother Bayou.

Brother Backwoods was given the task of managing and protecting the woods. His domain stretches from thickets packed thick with trees thin enough to use as a toothpick to the grandest redwood forests. He can choose to walk the forest in the shape of any of the critters who dwell there; he could hide as a tiny tick or attack as the grizzly bear its attached to.
